# Web3 & Blockchain Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my learning journey into Web3, Blockchain technology, and decentralized applications (DApps). The blockchain developer ecosystem has seen significant growth, with **33% growth in blockchain developers in 2022**.

## Future Learning Goals

- **High Performance Computing (HPC)** in AI/ML (2026)
- Advanced blockchain development and optimization

---

## Evolution of the Web

### Web 1.0 (1990s)

- **Read-only** websites with minimal functionality
- Built primarily with HTML and basic programming languages (C, etc.)
- Static content with limited user interaction

### Web 2.0 (2005 onwards)

- **Interactive** web applications
- Rise of social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- User-generated content and dynamic experiences
- **Key Issue**: "If you're not paying for it, you are the product"
- Centralized data control by major corporations

### Web 3.0 (Present & Future)

- **Decentralized** applications built on blockchain
- User ownership of data and digital assets
- Token-based economies

#### Web3 Examples:

- **[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)** - Decentralized wireless internet network
- **[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)** - Blockchain-based game where players own and trade characters (NFTs)
  - Developers take only 4.5% transaction fees
  - Players maintain ownership of in-game assets

## Understanding Blockchain

### What is a Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger shared across a network of computers.

**Key Concept**: A blockchain is essentially a **LEDGER** - a record of transactions and data.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Immutability

- Transaction history cannot be changed or tampered with
- Achieved through cryptographic encryption
- Each block is "locked" using complex mathematical algorithms

#### 2. Encryption Basics

```
Plain Message → Encryption → Cipher Text → Decryption → Original Message
```

- Traditional encryption uses shifts/ciphers (can be weak)
- Blockchain uses advanced cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block

#### 3. Decentralization

- No single point of control
- Distributed across multiple nodes
- Consensus mechanisms validate transactions

## Decentralized Applications (DApps)

### Traditional Startup Model (Web 2.0)

1. Build a startup
2. Seek venture capital funding
3. Grow user base
4. Eventually do an IPO
5. Monetize after years of development

**Example**: **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)**

- Raised ~$6,000,000 in early funding
- Time-consuming and difficult process
- Limited accessibility for founders

### Web3 DApp Model

1. Build the technology
2. Release tokens
3. **Earn from day one** as people use your technology
4. Community-driven governance through **DAOs** (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
5. Token holders govern how the project evolves

**Example**: **[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)**

- Raised **$257,000,000** through token sales
- Faster fundraising with broader accessibility
- Decentralized cloud storage solution

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

- Token holders vote on key decisions
- Democratic governance model
- Transparent and programmable rules

## Pseudonymity: A Key Feature of Web3

### Benefits:

- **Privacy Protection**: Users can interact without revealing personal information
- **Accountability**: Actions are still traceable on the blockchain
- **Permissionless Innovation**: No barriers based on:
  - Age
  - Geography
  - Race or ethnicity
  - Educational background
  - Economic status

**You can build groundbreaking applications based purely on merit and skill.**

## Building Your First DApp

### Choosing a Blockchain

When selecting a blockchain for your first DApp, consider:

- **Transaction costs** (gas fees)
- **Speed** (transactions per second)
- **Developer tools** and documentation
- **Community support**
- **Scalability** for future growth

### Recommended Learning Path

1. Learn blockchain fundamentals
2. Understand smart contracts
3. Choose a blockchain platform (Ethereum, Solana, etc.)
4. Learn Solidity (for Ethereum) or Rust (for Solana, ICP)
5. Explore development frameworks:
   - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
   - [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
   - [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
6. Build and deploy your first smart contract
7. Create a frontend using [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/)

## Some important links in order to understand how blockchain actually works:

- [SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html)
  SHA-Algorithm shows how hasing is done in bockchian/data
- [BlockchainDemo](https://guggero.github.io/blockchain-demo/#!/blockchain)
  this website shows how distributed blockchain works: Every peer has same block chain with same hash in order to make it immutaible.

# Smart Contracts:

-storing codes into the blocks of blockchain, and this code is executed automatically executed by the decentralised applications.

# Internet Computers (ICP)

- The goal of the internet computer is to reach blockchain singularity, powerful secure bloackchian that helps us to run the entire ecosystem on the blockchain.
- The biggest competitor of Ethereum blockchian is **Dfinity's Internet Computer**
- Large amount of data is costly to store in Ethereum bloackchain around 350,000,000$ for storing 1GB data.
- This is the main reason wht companies create partially decentralised apps, inted of fully decentralised apps.
- **ICP: Internet Computer:**is a decentralized network that hosts software and applications directly on the public internet, acting as an alternative to traditional cloud services.
  As a developer Internet computer is a whole bunch of canisters which can hold programs, program states through Web Assembly modeule and memory page.
  We will use Dfinity's motoko language in order to develop a decentralised app.
  **My decentralised Finance app is coming soon**

- I'm using Dfinity's Internet computing in order to develop a dcentralised finance app.
